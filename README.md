iOS News App 

⚠️ You'll need to add your own API Key inside the App to be able to use it : Utilities -> NewsAPIKey.swift ⚠️

This App is an upgrade of WorldWideNews App made with a complete different architecture 

- You can get the regular news in English, French and Italian
- You can search what you want to see by proper Name or by Source (ex: CNN)
- On the Search by name, you can change the settings from how the info are displayed (ex: Popularity, Latest or Revelancy) and define a search for a whole month maximum (because it is the maximum NewsAPI keep the news in there API)
- Finally, you can store the articles you want to read for later and even search within it (By Title, Source or Name)
